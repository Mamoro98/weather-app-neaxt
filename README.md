This Website is inspired by a UI/UX i saw on figma, check it out at :
https://www.figma.com/file/9M7MQ4LCCCNod8ivBohHoi/Weather-website-%26-Dark-Weather-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design

I used Nextjs, reactjs, typescript and css in this website.

if you dont know how to run a nextjs application, all you got to do is to clone the repository and run 2 commands :

1- npm i

2- npm run dev 
Voala ! it is running !
Or you can see the production version on Vercel !
here is the link : https://weather-morosama.vercel.app/

It is just for fun <3
